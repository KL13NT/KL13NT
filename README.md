### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nabil Tharwat, a software engineer, content creator, and mentor based in Cairo, Egypt. I started coding when I was 12 with VB, and now living in JS land. I love contributing to open source. Accessibility and performance are part of my eternal quest.

I run a YouTube [channel] and a weekly podcast called [The Weekly Noob]. I also founded an online community called [Valarium], make sure to check them out!

### Get in touch

[Email] and [Twitter] are your best channels. You can also find me on [LinkedIn] and [GitHub].

### Beyond work

When I'm not coding some frontend stuff I'm usually found experimenting, mentoring people new to the field, trying out new utilities on the market, blogging, going live, making videos and devlogs, or contributing to Valarium.

### To infinity and beyond
